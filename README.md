# employee-directory
An employee directory for a fictional startup called Awesome Startup. Twelve employees are randomly generated from the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/). Refreshing the page will request 12 new, random employees from the Random User Generator API.
Clicking on an employee's card will show a modal window with additional information about that employee.
The search bar filters employees by name. If after filtering the employees you wish to see the list of all employees again clear the search input field and submit the search form. This will display the original 12 employees.
